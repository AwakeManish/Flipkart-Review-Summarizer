# FlipKart Review Summarizer

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** FlipKart Review Summarizer

## Abstract

This project addresses the need for a more accurate and reliable approach to determine product ratings based on customer sentiment in Flipkart product reviews. The primary objective is to predict product ratings based on customer reviews to enhance the accuracy of Flipkart's existing rating system.

### Project Highlights

- **Data Collection:** We employed web scraping techniques to gather a comprehensive dataset of Flipkart product reviews. The data collection code is available in the `data_collection` folder.

- **Datasets:** The `datasets` folder contains seven different datasets, each representing product reviews extracted from Flipkart.

- **Analysis and Evaluation:** Our primary analysis, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, rating prediction, and evaluation are conducted in the `analysis_and_evaluation` folder. This code file encompasses the entire analysis, including data preprocessing and performance evaluation.

- **Project Report:** For detailed insights into the analysis and evaluation, you can access our comprehensive project report in the `Project_Report` folder. The report contains in-depth explanations of the methodology and results.

- **Documentation:** Additional project documentation, resources, and presentations can be found in the 'Documentation' section.

## Getting Started

To replicate our research and analysis, follow the instructions provided in the respective project folders. Detailed documentation and resources are available in the 'Documentation' section.

### Data Collection

1. Navigate to the `Data Collection` folder to find the Python script and/or notebook used for web scraping Flipkart reviews.

### Analysis, Data Cleaning, and Evaluation

1. The main analysis, including data cleaning, sentiment analysis, rating prediction, and evaluation, is conducted in the `Analysis and Evalution` folder. Start with the notebook file titled `Project_Review_Analysis.ipynb`. This notebook contains the merging of datasets, data cleaning, sentiment analysis, rating prediction, and graphical representations of the analysis results.

## Conclusion

Our project demonstrates the utility of sentiment analysis in predicting customer ratings based on their reviews. By implementing this approach, businesses can obtain more accurate and reliable feedback, leading to improved customer satisfaction and informed decision-making processes.
